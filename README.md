[Link to Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tyler8753/viz/NYCBIKEVIZ/NYCCITIBIKESTORY?publish=yes)

## Overview

Citi Bike has a successful bike sharing business model in NYC. In order to understand how this model works, I analyze data about Citi Bike's customers and how they use the bike share service. Gaining this understanding will help deploy bike share programs in other cities, like Des Moines. 



## Results

### Intrtoduction: Who are Citis' customers and how do customers use the bike-share service? 

The intro-visualization establishes that we are examining bike-share ridership in August. Top Left: I made a map of the most popular stations. The larger and more red circles are the most popular stations for riders to use. This page also includes the count of customers in August (2.344.224) and a pie chart breaking down yearly-subscribers and customers. Peak ridership by hour is presented on a bar chart at the bottom of the page. 

Using the Popular Stations map, we can infer that Manhattan hosts the most popular stations for Citi Bike. Second, We get an idea of how many monthly customers there are and how those customers are broken down into user-type. more than 75% of customers are yearly-subscribers. Lastly, August peak Hours are 7-9 AM and 430-830 PM.

### Gender

First, is the Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) heat map. The data reinforces our findings about peak hours but we start to gleem a different picture. Men seem to be using the bike-share service the most. In fact, male use of Citi Bike is by far the greatest, meaning Citi serves a mostly male demographic. 

Seceond, the Checkout Times by Gender map takes a deeper look into the behavior of customers by gender. While many more men are using the service they male and female customers appear to use the bike for about the same amount of time. This suggests that male and female identifying customers are using the service in similar ways.

### Top Start/Stop Locations 

These maps show the most popular start and stop locations. One may infer that bikes are being used most in dense urban areas to travel shorter distances. When we think of this map and the previous chart that showed avg checkout times, the data begins to tell the story of customers in dense urban areas with heavy traffic using Citi Bike to travel short distances during rush hours. Notice areas in Brooklyn have far less activity. Could these be commuters?

### Checkout Times 

Now that our story is starting to take shape let's look at Checkout Times for Users. Checkout Times for all users gives us an averaged look at the Checkout Times by Gender. The total Checkout Times for Users curve most closely reflects the Male curve on the Checkout Times by Gender Map. This reinforces our finding that most customers are male.

### Trips Data

At Last, we have to heat maps that reinforce our previous findings, Trips by Weekday and User Trips by Gender by Weekday. 

## Summary 

### What have we found ?

  Citi Bike customers are:
  * mostly Male
  * peak hours are 7-9 AM and 430-830 PM
  * Subscribers rather than customers 
  * riding on weekdays 

The results show that Citibank customers are mostly working class men commuting to and from work within the city. 

Additional visualizations

* Male and Female identifying customers seem to use the service in similar ways (checkout time) but men are using the service more often. Can more be done to target the Female demographic? I would like to do a heat map of female use of Citi Bike. 
* I would also like to do a visualization examining User Trips by age by Weekday to see what age demo is using the bikes at what times.
